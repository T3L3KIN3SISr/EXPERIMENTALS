## Game Launcher
You may use this application to download the Base Game and open the Unreal Project.
You don't need to use this at all.

You do need *.NET 8.0* to open this application. Windows should automatically help you install this dependancy.

>[!NOTE]
> If you have installed Unreal Engine in an *abnormal path*, the Launcher *won't detect Unreal Engine* however will still attempt to load the .uproject file through the Windows Shell.
